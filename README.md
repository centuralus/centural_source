# Centural Framework
The Backend Application Framework for the Centural Ledger

# Currently How to Use

- Step One
First you must install [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (If you plan to run the entire project go ahead and install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) which includes [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Then I HIGHLY recommend you research [ObjD](https://objd.stevertus.com/guide/#why-a-framework) our main driving force for
developing our Minecraft Vanilla Datapacks.

- Step Two
Run the command `dart .\core.dart` from within the parent directory of the project to Import the **centural_datapack/** base code into the ObjD Layer and out will Compile a final Datapack located inside **centural_datapack/centural**.

This Import Proccess will be designed in pair with [Brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) to correctly anylize the code, modify and
upgrade to be compatible and increase stability. Once the Import proccess has happened the ObjD layer may add, merge, or create new datapacks LIVE without the need of the server
rebooting.

- Step Three
Add onto the ObjD Layer or work on the Brigadier Lexar/Parser Layer implementation. (See Goals)

# Weekly Goal(s)
- Integrate [Brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) 
- User Full Stack Registration/Login/PasswordReset
- Guest Login Option
- Link From Game to Server
- Guest Dashboard (Player Count, Player Names with Role, Message (Only avaiable to players with Chat Online))
- User Dashboard (^- Same as Guest, If Linked From Game to server; can View/Manage Inventory, and more...)
- Admin Dashboard (^- Same as Above, Start Stop Server, Run Commands, Advance Command/Pluggin Interface

# Inactive Assignments(s)
- EXAMPLE Use [Open NoteBlock Studio](https://opennbs.org/) to Compose Music for the Muse Role. (*Do not remove this from the Inactive Assignment List*)

# Active Assignment(s)
- 

# Completed Assignment(s)
- Import in old Datapack/ObjD Project

# How to Contribute
Please do not hesitate to send a pull request or open an issue for a suggestion, bug, patch, questions, or anything you may need to discuss regarding the porject!

I will try to keep this list as clear as possible regarding where to project is, what is currently complete, what needs to be complete, etc. However if you see lack in 
clear documentation or would like to help out with cleaning up anything documented that would be greatly appreciated! (I am basically saying to
keep the codebase clean so lets work together to keep the communication open and direction of the project clear.) 

- If you are working on something PLEASE UPDATE THE README and add the Active Assignment(s) you are working on.
- If you are complete with an Active Assignment update the Completed Assignment(s).
- You may grab an Inactive Tasks but try to figure out who was working on it last unless it is a general task (Which are marked *Do not remove from Inactive Assignment List*)

# Useful Tools
[Cloud Wolf](https://cloudwolfyt.github.io/index.html) has many tools and Helpful Videos so please check out his content.  
[McStacker](https://mcstacker.net/) can be used to help make commands using a Browser Base Interface.  
[TellRaw Generator](https://minecraftjson.com/) from MinecraftJson is also a nice Browser Base Interface for forming Tellraw,Screen Overlays,Sign, and Books. (You can alse use this same generated Text in a Team Preffix/Suffix and a few other commands.)  
[Open NoteBlock Studio](https://opennbs.org/) to Compose Music by either Converting MIDI into Noteblocks or writing your own peice within the Interface.
